# Introduction

Trees play a decisive role for both the population and the planet. 
It has been demonstrated in various studies that the presence of trees and nature in the cities can improve the community's mental health, youngster's attention span, and therefore their test scores, and beyond.

Cities must consider trees in their plans to reach sustainability goals. Trees cool our urban centers and provide benefits that can lead cities to tackle 15 out of 17 SDG - Sustainable development goals - globally supported by the United Nations.

In this project, we will explore Melbourne city's urban forest, and try to take some conclusions on how it influences or is influenced by demographic aspects.

***

The City of Melbourne currently maintains more than 70,000 trees planted all around the urban space, however, we only have cleaned, and accurate data for nearly 54,000, and therefore only this number of trees will be considered over the entire analysis. 

Since 2003, due to the 'Melbourne's Urban Forest project, different types of trees were planted slowly covering the city with green areas as we can see in the video below.

In the following visualization, one can get a perspective of where are the more mature trees planted, as well as the newest ones. The darker the dots are, the more mature a tree is. When compared with the video above, it can be seen that the most developed trees are located in the oldest part of the city (left side) that nowadays are not more densely populated by trees than other surrounding areas.
