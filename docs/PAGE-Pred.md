title: Life expectancy of trees
description: Prediction challenge
---


It would be very useful for cities' green departments to access the remaining life expectancy of the existing trees. Knowing this information would play an important role in urban forest planning and sustainability reporting.

Therefore, we create a model that predicts the 'Useful time expectancy' of a tree based on some trees' characteristics such as 
* Name, Genus and Family,
* Diameter of the breast height, 
* The year it was planted and its Age description',
* Weather it is located on a street or a park.
